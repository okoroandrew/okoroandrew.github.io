Hi, I'm Chimaobi.  
I'm a second-year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, co-advised by Professors [Joyce Chai](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chaijy/) and [Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/). Before Michigan, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [FUTO, Nigeria](https://futo.edu.ng/), where I specialized in Electronics Engineering (ECE) and graduated as the best student in my class. 

My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing, with a focus on alignment, personalization, LLM safety, robustness, and reasoning.
