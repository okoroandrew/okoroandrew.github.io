I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University at Albany, State University of New York, advised by [Mariya Zheleva](https://www.cs.albany.edu/~mariya/lab/index.html).

My research develops AI/ML frameworks for spectrum analytics—detecting, characterizing, and localizing wireless transmitters in complex radio frequency environments. I work at the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, and wireless communications to address critical challenges in spectrum management, enforcement, and coexistence.

My work has been published at top-tier venues including IEEE INFOCOM 2024, INFOCOM 2025, and IEEE DySPAN 2024. As a student member of NSF SpectrumX, I have access to the POWDER testbed for large-scale experimentation and regularly disseminate my research to federal agencies, academic researchers, and industry practitioners. I have served as a facilitator for the SpectrumX Summer School on Wireless for three years, training the next generation of spectrum researchers from diverse institutions.
