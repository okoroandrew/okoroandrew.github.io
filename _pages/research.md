My research develops AI and machine learning frameworks for spectrum analytics, addressing critical challenges in wireless spectrum management, interference detection, and spectrum coexistence. I work at the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, and wireless communications to create practical tools for detecting, characterizing, and localizing radio transmitters in complex environments.

## Research Areas

**Automated Spectrum Monitoring**  
Developing unsupervised machine learning methods that detect and characterize wireless transmitters without requiring labeled training data. These frameworks enable real-time spectrum monitoring for enforcement, interference mitigation, and spectrum sharing applications.

**Spectrum Data Trustworthiness**  
Creating methods to assess the reliability of spectrum measurements across different sensor platforms. This work helps ensure that spectrum policy decisions are based on trustworthy data and enables effective use of heterogeneous sensor networks.

**Harmonic Interference Detection**  
Developing multi-spectral frameworks that detect harmonic emissions and map them to their fundamental sources. This capability protects radio astronomy facilities and scientific observations from interference caused by out-of-band emissions.

**Joint Detection and Localization**  
Building frameworks that enable simultaneous transmitter detection and spatial localization from distributed sensor measurements. This unified approach improves efficiency for spectrum enforcement and emergency response scenarios.

## Research Frameworks

**SCAN: Sparse reCovery trAnsmitter detectioN**  
An unsupervised framework that detects multiple overlapping transmitters in complex, noisy spectrum environments. SCAN reliably detects up to ten concurrent transmitters and has been validated through extensive over-the-air experiments.

**M-SHarC: Multi-Spectral Harmonic Characterization**  
A framework that identifies harmonic emissions across multiple frequency bands and reconciles them with their fundamental sources. M-SHarC addresses interference that threatens radio astronomy and scientific observations.

**MDL: Multi-vantage Detection and Localization**  
A unified framework that enables joint transmitter detection and localization from a single measurement campaign using distributed sensors. Preliminary results show 2x to 12x improvement in localization accuracy.

**RadView: Robust Radar Detection**  
A wavelet-based framework for detecting narrow-band, short-lived signals in high-noise environments. RadView enables high-sensitivity detection of Navy radar pulses for CBRS spectrum sharing.

**VIA: Veracity, Intermittency, and Ambiguity**  
A framework that assesses spectrum data fidelity by profiling sensor capabilities and predicting measurement reliability across different hardware platforms.
