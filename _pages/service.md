## Research Infrastructure & Community Service

### Data Annotation & Curation

**SpectrumX Very Large Array (VLA) Data Annotation Lead** (July 2024 - Present)  
Leading the annotation effort for 4 terabytes of spectrum data collected at the VLA in New Mexico. Working with the SpectrumX AI/ML working group to label transmitter signatures and ambient noise patterns. This annotated dataset will be made publicly available through SpectrumX's Spectrum Data System to support nationwide spectrum research.

### Educational Activities
